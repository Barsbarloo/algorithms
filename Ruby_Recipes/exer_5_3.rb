# For entry into engineering or medicine, when the score is calculated, some of the credit is 
# taken from the marks in the exam discussed earlier. These are the rules:
# •	 up to 500 marks: no credit toward entrance
# •	 501 to 600: 10 credits
# •	 601 to 700: 20 credits
# •	 701 to 800: 40 credits
# •	 801 onward: 70 credits
# Write a program to determine and print the credits each of the students received 
# (based on the hash in Exercise 5.2).
